## 2. Abstract

SmartStudy Hub is a full‑stack web application designed to help students plan their studies, manage tasks, and track their daily study habits. The system allows users to register and log in securely, create and organize subjects, manage tasks with priorities and due dates, and record study sessions using an interactive timer. All data is stored in a MySQL database and processed through PHP on the server side, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used on the client side for an interactive user interface.

A unique feature of SmartStudy Hub is the habit tracking and gamification module. The application automatically calculates a user’s daily study streak and awards badges based on cumulative study time, number of study sessions, and streak length. An analytics section provides insights into total time spent per subject and task completion rates, presented through tables and a simple custom chart.

The project demonstrates complete CRUD operations, session management, AJAX‑based communication, and basic data analytics, making it a comprehensive full‑stack project suitable for academic evaluation and real‑world use.

## 3. Introduction

### 3.1 Background

Students often struggle to stay consistent with studies, especially when managing multiple subjects, assignments, and exams. Traditional methods like physical diaries or basic to‑do apps do not provide insights into actual time spent studying or patterns in daily performance.

With the increasing accessibility of web technologies, it is possible to build applications that help students:

- Plan their work
- Visualize progress
- Stay motivated through gamification

### 3.2 Problem Statement

Existing simple note‑taking or to‑do applications lack:

- Structured subject‑wise organization
- Study time tracking
- Habit streak tracking
- Badges and achievements to keep motivation high

There is a need for a centralized web platform where students can manage their subjects and tasks, track actual study time, and receive feedback and rewards based on their efforts.

### 3.3 Objectives

The main objectives of SmartStudy Hub are:

- To provide a secure, user‑friendly web interface for students to manage their study activities.
- To support subject and task management with priorities and due dates.
- To track study sessions using a timer and store duration details in the database.
- To calculate daily streaks and overall study statistics.
- To implement a badge system that rewards users for their consistency and effort.
- To present analytics that help users understand their study patterns.

## 5. Existing System vs Proposed System

### 5.1 Existing System

Many students currently use:

- Paper planners or notebooks
- Basic mobile to‑do lists
- Simple calendar reminders

**Limitations of the existing system:**

- No automatic calculation of study time.
- No visualization of how much time was spent per subject.
- No concept of streaks or achievements.
- Data is scattered and not centralized.

### 5.2 Proposed System

SmartStudy Hub is a centralized web solution that offers:

- User‑based login and secure data storage.
- Subject‑wise management and task tracking.
- Timer‑based study session tracking.
- Automatic calculation of daily streaks and total study minutes.
- A badge system for motivation.
- Analytics to show completion percentages and time distribution.

**Advantages:**

- Accessible from any device with a browser.
- Structured and organized information.
- Encourages consistent daily study through streaks and badges.
- Provides useful insights to plan better.

## 6. System Design

### 6.1 Overall Architecture

SmartStudy Hub follows the classic **client‑server** architecture:

- **Client Side:**
    - HTML for structure
    - CSS for styling (responsive layout, cards, tables)
    - JavaScript for timer logic, AJAX calls, and basic chart rendering
- **Server Side:**
    - PHP for business logic, input validation, session handling, and database interaction
- **Database:**
    - MySQL for persistent storage of users, subjects, tasks, study sessions, and badges

Communication between client and server happens via HTTP and, for some features (like saving a study session), via **AJAX** (`fetch()` in JavaScript calling a PHP endpoint).

### 6.2 Major Modules

1. **User Authentication Module**
    - Handles registration, login, and logout.
    - Uses password hashing for security.
    - Uses PHP sessions to maintain logged‑in state.
2. **Subjects Module**
    - Allows users to create, view, and delete subjects.
    - Each subject stores a name, description, and target hours per week.
3. **Tasks Module**
    - Allows creation and viewing of tasks linked to subjects.
    - Each task has title, description, due date, priority, and status.
    - Supports marking tasks as completed.
4. **Study Sessions Module**
    - Provides a timer interface.
    - Uses JavaScript to start/stop timing and communicate with the server via AJAX.
    - Stores duration, subject, date, and timestamp in the database.
5. **Analytics Module**
    - Shows total study minutes per subject.
    - Shows number of tasks and completed tasks per subject.
    - Calculates completion percentage for each subject.
6. **Streak & Badge Module (Unique Feature)**
    - Calculates current daily streak based on study sessions on consecutive days.
    - Tracks total minutes and total number of sessions.
    - Awards badges stored in `badges` and `user_badges` tables.
    - Displays badges on the dashboard and profile.

## 8. Testing

### 8.1 Test Plan

The application was tested using the following methods:

- **Unit Testing:**
    - Testing individual modules such as registration, login, subject addition, task creation, and session saving.
- **Integration Testing:**
    - Ensuring the proper flow between modules, for example:
        - A study session saved via AJAX appears in sessions list and updates analytics.
        - Badge awarding works after multiple sessions.
- **Validation Testing:**
    - Verifying that required fields are not left empty.
    - Ensuring invalid input (e.g., negative minutes) is rejected server‑side.

### 8.2 Sample Test Cases

1. **User Registration**
    - Input: Valid name, email, matching passwords.
    - Expected: New user created and redirected to login with success message.
2. **Login with Incorrect Password**
    - Input: Existing email, wrong password.
    - Expected: Error message “Invalid email or password.”
3. **Add Subject**
    - Input: Subject name and optional description.
    - Expected: Subject appears in subject list and is available in tasks and timer dropdown.
4. **Add Study Session**
    - Action: Start timer, stop after a few minutes.
    - Expected: Session saved, appears in sessions list, dashboard stats and analytics updated.
5. **Badges**
